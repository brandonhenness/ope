BUG SMC - Student attempt to change password, AD error saying "unable to change pw on non existent account"
    - AD._ldap - Being init, but not connected results in all future connection attempts to bypass actual bind call
        Setting _ldap back to null on connect exception should cause full connection attempt next time around.

BUG Canvas database config - connection pool timeout.
    - Set at 5000 (5 sec). Upped to 50000 helps, trying 300000.
    - Why slow connection pool? Specifically on large course import (400+ meg).
	- Is this a connection pool issue or not enough threads/workers running?
	- Also trying puma.rb (change threads to 16,32, workers to 6, turn off preload)??
	- Dropped delayed_worker count to 2 from 4
	- Update dastabase.yml to have a pool parameter which ups the connection pool from 5

BUG Codecombat doesn't copy dump.tar.gz and import it properly offline - volume not syncing?

BUG Canvas importing imscc > 600 meg - timeout - seems to work with direct connection to canvas port, seems to be nginx/gateway timeout issue


- ADD START_BOOT -> FINISH_BOOT status file for each container so we can see when things like canvas are actually online and ready

Done - on startup from cmd env Set password on SMC container (cleaner way to set initial password?)
Done - Import smc data from seperate repo
Done ? - SMC first run - debug lazy_tables on
Done - called on startup Command line password set - change admin and parameters file

download_volume_data.py - TODO

sync_to_portable_drive.py - TODO

sync_from_portable_drive.py - TODO

Need canvas, redis, postgresql images

Change permissions on volumes folder (invalid user access?)

Canvas - setup initial plugins and settings
 - turn off email between students, 
 
VOLUMES - fix cleanup_images.py to NOT delete volumes we want to keep



Host Machine Requirements
Docker installed  ---   https://susestudio.com/a/P08rUy/ope-docker - This is a linux that can be installed in a VM (vmware player or virtual box) or bare metal to run docker if you don't have a machine that is ready to run docker already.
Git
Python 2.7.?
Clone - https://github.com/frankyrumple/ope

Steps
Checkout ope project with Git to a machine that can run docker (windows is fine if you have the docker for win packages installed)
Make sure .enabled files exist in the folders for the containers you want (you will need gateway and dns)
Run: python rebuild_compose.py   (should auto detect IP and ask you what domain to use - I have everything using .ed - khan.ed, smc.ed, jsbin.ed....)
Set a DNS forwarder to forward all ed domains to the IP of the docker machine (In Active directory, add a conditional forwarder)
From the ope folder run: docker-compose build
Once building is complete, run: docker-compose up -d
If DNS/etc is setup properly go to: http://jsbin.dev    (may take a minute before you can view it, it will be compiling the node stuff on startup)
Data should be saved in a sub folder of ope called volumes (e.g. user dbs, etc...)
I need to do work on automating this more and sync the data/images to a USB drive. Work in progress... With docker you can use the python scripts to export/import the built images so you can take them to an offline server.

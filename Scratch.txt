-- OVERVIEW

This system allows you to prep containers online, then move them to an offline
location easily. To do this you will need a computer running Docker with access
to the internet as well as a computer running Docker in the target offline location.

Online Computer  --> Sync to USB Drive --> Sync USB Drive to offline computer

ONLINE COMPUTER
1) Install containers on a computer with online access
2) Configure contianers as needed and download files/updates/etc...
3) Sync containers and data to a portable drive
OFFLINE COMPUTER
4) Sync containers and data from portable drive to offline machine
5) Fire up containers offline and enjoy
TWO WAY SYNC (OPTIONAL)
6) If two way sync is supported, you can run the sync script inside
	to sync from offline system back to portable drive
7) Run sync FROM portable drive to push back to online system
8) Repeat as needed....



-- INSTALL DOCKER - ONLINE and OFFLINE


-- CHECKOUT OPE BUILD FILES


-- GENERATE COMPOSE FILE

Create a file in each container folder called .enabled then run the rebuild_compose.py script
to generate a docker-compose script.

-- START DOCKER

In the ope folder, run docker-compose up -d to start the containers.


---- FIX Encryption Key Hash Error
cd /ope/docker_build_files
docker-compose exec ope-canvas /bin/bash -c "/home/docker/.gem/ruby/2.4.0/bin/rake --trace db:reset_encryption_key_hash"

docker-compose down
##### DOESN'T WORK W OUT START.SH to setup yml files
docker-compose run --rm ope-canvas /bin/bash -c "/home/docker/.gem/ruby/2.4.0/bin/rake  --trace db:reset_encryption_key_hash"
# $GEM_HOME - /home/docker/.gem/ruby/2.4.0

---- CHANGE IP

Template with new ip??? ((needed if we add docker A entry?))

---- DNS SETUP
Add conditional forwarder for .ed domain to IP of docker machine
Add A entry for docker?


---- INSTALL DOCKER SERVICES
 - WinDocker
	- Make sure to share!!!
 - Premade image (in VM or on bare metal)
	- Setup IP, Route, DNS, IP Forwarding
	- CHANGE PASSWORD

	
	
# Run with docker-compose up -d
# Scale with docker-compose scale machine=2

# Save
# -------docker save imgname > imgname.tar
# docker save -o image.tar imagename
# Load
# -------docker load < imgname.tar
# docker load -i image.tar

# Cleanup old containers
# docker rm -v $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
# Cleanup old images
# docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
# Cleanup old volumes
# docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)

# ----------- Outside setup -----------------
# Install Docker
#   - (Win) Enable share
#   - (Linux) chkconf docker on
# Create volumes folder (one for each container)
# checkout docker data (compose file, docker files, use GIT)
# Launch with docker-compose
# Indiviual container configs
#   - kalite - setup new account online and pick videos to sync
# Save container images to external drive
# RSync volumes folder to external drive


# ----------- Inside setup -----------------
# Install Docker
#   - (Win) Enable share
#   - (Linux) chkconf docker on
#   - chkconfig sshd on
#   - Extend volume
#      - pvresize /dev/vda2
#   - Change root pw
#   - change resolve.conf (nameserver 10.1.39.1??)
# Create volumes folder (one for each container)
# RSync from external drive
# Load container images
# Lauch w docker-compose (docker-compose up -d)
